# Task-Management-Web-Application

Building an Application for Task Management amongst multiple Users.

In this project, a task management system that can deal with tasks 
of multiple users is built. Users will have the ability to create task
boards which are collections of tasks. Users will also have the ability to invite
other users to see and interact with their created boards.

For example, if I create a board I can add users to it and anyone who creates
a task can assign that task to any user who is part of that board. Users should
be able to edit and delete tasks as well as mark them complete. The only person
who can delete the entire board though is the original creator.

For this application, the parent child relationships available through the NoSQL 
database is explored. This application was built without using a query of any kind. 
This is achived by properly organising and managing keys to directly access 
everything without the use of a query.
